# About Me Page 

My name is Cole Ragone. I am a senior here at W&M who, by accident and lack of knowledge, has not taken their COLL 100. I am an Economics major with a minor in Business Analytics,
so this COLL 100 fits well. I know my approach in this class will be different then most students, because I am a senior, but I look forward to the knowledge I will learn. 

Personally, I am on the baseball team, which is by biggest passion in life. I love the sport, both playing and analyzing. I would love to find a job that is somehow related to the
sport itself.
